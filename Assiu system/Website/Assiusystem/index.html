            <h4>The most popular web technologies of 2019</h4><br>
            
            <p>"The world of web development is constantly changing and it is a challenge that closely monitors everything that is happening."<br><strong>What will remain relevant in the coming year?</strong><br>"What are the most appropriate programming languages for your web application? Let's discuss six interesting techniques for developing a network."</p><br>
            
            <h4>React.js</h4><br>
            
            <p>"With <strong>React.js</strong>, developers can build reusable components, each with its own state. If one of the components on the page needs to be updated (for example, the user clicks the "Like" button), the thumb mark appears automatically without the need to refresh the entire page."</p><br>
            
            <p>"<strong>React.js</strong> has been used by big companies like Airbnb and Netflix for several years, and we see that this technology is being adopted by more and more companies.
            The interest in interaction between developers is great and this makes it a popular technology in the coming years."</p><br>
            
            <h4>vue.js</h4><br>
            
            <p>"An important newcomer in front end development is <strong>Vue.js</strong>, a javascript framework with the fastest growing and possibly most enthusiastic developer community at the moment.
            Thanks to the highly detailed documentation and fairly low learning curve, <strong>Vue.js</strong> is a good choice when you want to try out a new framework as a developer."</p><br>
            
            <p>"Because of the similarity of <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Angular</strong> in terms of construction method, it is an easy transition from other frames.
            Liked by <strong>Vue.js</strong> for its compact size (only 20kb), speed and flexibility offer better performance compared to other front end frames."</p><br>
            
            <p>"<strong>Vue.js</strong> currently still has a fairly small market share compared to <strong>React</strong> or <strong>Angular</strong>. Finding developers with experience on <strong>Vue.js</strong> can be a little more difficult. Whether Vue becomes as popular as <strong>React</strong> or <strong>Angular</strong> we will have to wait and follow up, but given the positive perspectives from the developer community and the growth in <strong>Vue</strong> usage, it seems likely that <strong>Vue.js</strong> will continue to evolve positively."</p><br>
            
            <h4>jQuery</h4><br>
            
            <p>"The developer community appears to be slowly moving away from the most popular <strong>JavaScript</strong> library. One of the reasons may be that <strong>jQuery</strong> isn't working well with newer libraries like <strong>React</strong>. Modern browsers today support many <strong>jQuery</strong>-like functions, which in many cases make <strong>jQuery</strong> unnecessary. For this reason, we see that the use of <strong>JavaScript</strong> is much more than that. For example, GitHub recently announced that it had replaced the <strong>JQuery</strong> with pure <strong>JAVASCRIPT</strong>."</p><br>
            
            <p>"<strong>JQuery</strong> may not always be the first choice when starting a new project, with 300,000 downloads per day, but it achieved 300% good growth compared to the beginning of 2017. Perhaps more surprising: 90% of the top 500,000 sites still use <strong>jQuery</strong>! This indicates that the library does not have to be new and wonderful to remain relevant. The choice to use a particular library depends entirely on the type of project you want to use for it."</p><br>
            
            <p>"Each of the frameworks / libraries has a different philosophy and each has its own strength, but the only thing we can be sure of is that <strong>JavaScript</strong> is the foundation of all these developments. Therefore, a development team with strong knowledge and experience with <strong>JavaScript</strong> is essential to building modern websites and web applications."</p>

            <h4>The importance of the economy in our lives</h4><br>
            
            <p>"The family failure and the deterioration of life is the responsibility of the poor economy or in other words, the misuse of money. Therefore, the person must be moderate in his personal and family expenses, because this has great effects on the life of the individual and we can, through the arrangement of our economic life, reap the fruits of perhaps the most important one."</p><br>
            
            <p>"<strong>Help in making the appropriate decision:</strong> The success of the decision-making process depends on following the right steps, depending on the accuracy and timing of decision-making. It is important for a person to know when to take a particular step or decision because of the consequences that result, so the person must be aware of the dimensions of the decision he takes until he reaches the desired goal, and no one can ignore the role of our economic life arrangement in that."</p><br>
            
            <p>"<strong>Getting rid of poverty:</strong> One of the causes of poverty is the mismanagement of money or what is known as the failure of the individual economic system that leads to poverty, because of the lack of keenness to cover the important needs and save an amount of money for the future and its burdens."</p><br>
            
            <p>"<strong>Achieving a good standard of living:</strong> those whose income is limited and insufficient should search for a good standard of living, and the economic system of money can achieve this by exploiting some money to achieve the goals, the most important thing that the poor person should strive for is to find successful small projects that enter It has a good financial return, and this matter can only succeed if it applies the economy in money and saves part of it for projects that achieve a good standard of living. The economy gives the ability and courage to achieve the goals through the availability of part of the saved money."</p><br>
            
            <p>"<strong>Achieving happiness:</strong> economizing with money and knowing how to behave in the right way achieves happiness for the person and also for the whole family, because money is a way to avoid and address the problems that a person falls into, and there are many crises in life that are dealt with money only and not as some believe, for example when Buying something as important as a car or self-entertainment can only be achieved with money."</p><br>

            <h4>The most important 6 financial strategies</h4><br>
            
            <p>"The beginning of the new year represents an opportunity and a starting point for many people to participate in financial planning, setting goals and preparing for them, while controlling financial issues helps individuals reduce stress and improve their lifestyle for a safer future. The development of financial rules and foundations also helps guide individuals to make decisions that help them control their financial situation."</p><br>

            <h4>Prepare a budget</h4><br>
            
            <p>"Budget is one of the most important financial planning factors, as many people do not follow this step which is an essential task for the success of any effort in the framework of financial planning. Preparing the budget helps to visualize financial goals and define spending priorities, as the budget setting and commitment system not only puts individuals on the correct financial path for the new year, but also in the future, because that will lead to instilling positive financial behavior in their lives, moreover. By developing a real budget, individuals can determine where they are spending excessively."</p><br>
            
            <h4>Dealing with debt</h4><br>
            
            <p>"Not all debts are equal, so you should list them and organize them according to the annual interest rate, as debts with higher interest rates (most likely your credit card debt) must be paid first. Minimum payments can still be made in relation to other debts. If the interest rate is too high, other refinancing options can be considered to obtain low interest rates, provided that the total installments are less than your current payment, and you should continue to think and find the best ways to get rid of the debt-related financial problems."</p><br>
            
            <h4>Automatic saving</h4><br>
            
            <p>"If your financial decision is to save more money, using an automated savings plan will compel you to follow up because cash is drawn directly from your bank before you can lay your hands on it, but banks often provide free services that transfer a fixed amount of money From your account to your savings account every month, you will then find yourself more able to control money in the end with great ease in saving money."</p><br>
            
            <h4>Determining the goal</h4><br>
            
            <p>"Setting and maintaining short-term, medium-term and long-term financial goals is an important step towards achieving financial security, as annual financial planning gives you an opportunity to formally review and update your goals (if necessary), and to review your progress since last year. So without the goals, there will be no strong incentives to save money, and therefore you may spin a vicious cycle of credit card debt, and feel that you do not have enough cash to do what is necessary in the near future."</p><br>
            
            <h4>Retirement planning</h4><br>
            
            <p>"Early retirement planning is of great importance in terms of financial regulation and enjoying a stable life, as the person’s average saving rate must match his or her income and lifestyle, and therefore the amount of what one needs for retirement must be calculated including the basic income for daily living expenses (household bills, etc.) , And estimated income for emergencies, also thinking about how these income requirements have changed over time."</p><br>
            
            <h4>Error evaluation</h4><br>
            
            <p>"It is necessary for the individual to assess the financial errors in the previous year, by taking an honest look at the financial performance to know the strengths and weaknesses and dealing with them from the new year, and commitment to responsible standards towards financial life, as financial discipline begins with daily and regular expenses, for example, a card cannot be used Credit to purchase things that cannot be paid in full at the end of each month, with savings being given a higher priority than spending."</p><br>
